# emusun

I always wanted to fully Decompile an application from assembly, Write a C2 emulator, and learn how to reverse Golang, 
well I found the perfect sample for what I want, here I have fully decompiled sunshuttle from x64 Assembly to Go and wrote a C2 emulator that can interact with it, as well as the actual sample.

I have used IDA Pro Dissassembler (NO DECOMPILER), x64dbg and Go.

Sample: (MD5: 9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd)

Reference: 

- Got me started with Go reverse engineering highly recommended: [Reversing in action: Golang malware used in the SolarWinds attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cL-OwU9pFQ)

- Got the sample from here: [New SUNSHUTTLE Second-Stage Backdoor Uncovered Targeting U.S.-Based Entity; Possible Connection to UNC2452](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/sunshuttle-second-stage-backdoor-targeting-us-based-entity)
